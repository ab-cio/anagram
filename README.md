## Requirements
* Python â‰¥3.5. There are no package dependencies.
* File containing a list of unique lowercase words, one per line.

## Design
The `AnagramFinder` class has a one-time initialization cost of finding and
caching the anagrams of all words.  As such, the class is optimized for fast
lookups of anagrams of _multiple_ individual words.

## Usage

### Clone
    $ git clone https://github.com/ab-cio/anagram.git
    $ cd ./anagram/

### Help
	$ python3.5 anagram -h
	usage: anagram [-h] word [file]
	
	List anagrams.
	
	positional arguments:
	  word        Word, e.g. "empires"
	  file        Words file (default: "words.txt")
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
	
	Nothing is listed if no anagram is found.
	
### Example
	$ python3.5 anagram empires ./words.txt
	premise
	emprise
	imprese
	spireme
	epimers

## Performance

	$ wc ./words.txt 
	 413988  413988 4381051 ./words.txt
	
	$ /usr/bin/time -v python3.5 anagram empires ./words.txt
	premise
	emprise
	imprese
	spireme
	epimers
