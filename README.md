## Requirements
* Python â‰¥3.5. There are no package dependencies.
* File containing a list of unique lowercase words, one per line.

## Design
The anagram finder is designed with a one-time initialization cost of finding
and caching the anagrams of all words.  As such, it is optimized for fast
lookups of anagrams of _multiple_ individual words.

The sort order of the word list is preserved in the returned anagrams. Using a
sorted word list will ensure that the returned anagrams are also sorted.

## Clone
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ab-cio/anagram.git
$ cd ./anagram/
```

## Shell usage

### Help
```
$ python3.5 anagram -h
usage: anagram [-h] word [file]

List anagrams.

positional arguments:
  word        Word, e.g. "empires"
  file        Words file (default: "words.txt")

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

Nothing is listed if no anagram is found.
```
	
### Example
```
$ python3.5 anagram empires ./words.txt
premise
emprise
imprese
spireme
epimers
```

## Module usage
```python
>>> import anagram
>>> words_file = open('words.txt')
>>> anagram_finder = anagram.AnagramFinder(words_file)  # Slow
>>> anagram_finder.find('empires')  # Fast
['premise', 'emprise', 'imprese', 'spireme', 'epimers']
>>> anagram_finder.find('code')  # Fast
['deco', 'coed', 'ecod']
```

## Shell performance
```
$ wc ./words.txt 
 413988  413988 4381051 ./words.txt

$ /usr/bin/time -v python3.5 anagram empires ./words.txt
premise
emprise
imprese
spireme
epimers
